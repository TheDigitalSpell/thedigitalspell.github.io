Accept the challenge of the mind to relieve boredom and become a clever brainiac in the abstract yet elegant, immersive and stunning realm of **COLORCAST**. Feel the emotions and push your brain training as you relax in its pleasant environment and improve your spatial skills to find the clever solution.

**COLORCAST** is easy to learn, but hard to master! The aim is to unlock all the gates in the game. To do this, it is essential to learn the use of the elements, starting with the smart boxes, which have different configurations at the start of the game. These allow you to move colour packs around the level in an attempt to unlock the gates. Gradually, there are reflections from slash mirrors, railway yards or side beams blocking the path, as well as loops.... Discover them all!
