In an exciting new collaboration with [Legends of Learning](https://www.legendsoflearning.com/), we are thrilled to introduce **Equadeck**—the educational game where solving equations step by step goes from a daily chore to a thrilling mission. Forget boring worksheets; here, every variable you clear brings you closer to victory!

Your goal is simple: complete rounds, grow your score, and climb the ranks. Will you start in the Plastic tier, or do you have what it takes to reach the prestigious **Gold** rank? 🏆

Get ready to isolate that x!

## Master the Setup

The first step to solving any mystery is understanding the clues. Equadeck helps you visualize the problem before you even start calculating.

Each level presents clear variable descriptions at the top of the screen. Your job is to connect those descriptions with the correct values (p, q, and r) in the solving area below. It's the perfect way to understand *what* the equation means before you try to solve it.

## Solve Like a Detective

Once the equation is set up, the real action begins!

Equadeck guides you through the logical process of isolating x using **inverse operations**. Need to undo an addition? Subtract! Is there a multiplication? Divide!

You'll learn to make strategic decisions step by step, building your math confidence with every correct move.

## Instant Feedback to Grow

Made a mistake? No problem! True learning happens when we correct our errors.

Equadeck features an instant visual feedback system to keep you on track. If you get it right, you'll see a **yellow checkmark** and earn a star for your score. If you slip up, the game shows a **red cross** (error) alongside a blue circle pointing out the correction.

Learn from the mistake, keep an eye on your life points, and try again until you master the equation!

## How to Play: Your Step-by-Step Mission

Starting your Equadeck journey is super easy. Here is your game plan:

* **1. The Mission:** Your goal is to solve **10 equations in a row** to successfully complete a match. Keep that streak alive!
* **2. The Setup:** Check your screen. The top shows the word problem descriptions, and the bottom is your active solving area.
* **3. Arrange Variables:** Place the values for **p, q, and r** into their correct spots to build the equation. Press "Check" to validate your arrangement. Be careful—mistakes will cost you life points! If your life reaches 0, you'll have to retry the equation.
* **4. Inverse Operation:** Time to get x all by itself. Use the menu to apply the opposite operation (Add, Subtract, Divide) and solve it step by step.
* **5. Climb the Rank:** Every correct solution boosts your score. Rack up points to graduate from Plastic, to Bronze, Silver, and finally Gold!
