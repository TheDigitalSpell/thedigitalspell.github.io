**Welcome to GeoBots, a collection of interactive adventures designed for curious minds aged 3-6.**

The GeoBots are friendly robots on a mission to explore our planet. Through their eyes, children discover new cultures, solve physics-based puzzles, and learn about the world in a safe, stress-free environment.

We believe digital toys should be as safe and caring as physical ones. That is why the entire GeoBots series is built as a **"Walled Garden"**—a protected space where children can explore at their own pace, free from noise and distractions.

## Our Philosophy: Calm Tech

**🛡️ The "Walled Garden" Guarantee** 100% Kid-Safe. No Ads. No Outbound Links. No Data Tracking. A digital space where parents can truly relax while their children play.

**🧘 Respectful Design** Designed to respect your child's attention span. No flashing lights, no stressful timers, and no "Game Over." Just pure, self-paced exploration and learning.

**📦 Tactile & Physics-Based** Built with Godot 4, our world feels real. Buttons have weight, objects react to gravity, and interactions are designed to develop fine motor skills.
