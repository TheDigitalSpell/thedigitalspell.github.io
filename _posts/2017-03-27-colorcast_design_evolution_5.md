Greetings from the final installment of the series. Following our time at Gamelab and Gamepolis 2015, a number of artists offered us advice on how to make the game's graphics better.

While some of the remarks were contradictory, everyone seemed to agree that the colors needed to be improved and made more distinctive in order to better define the color scheme. The tone and shadows of the smart boxes also needed to be unified.

We employed the following tools to address these problems:

- [Paletton](https://paletton.com) We saved a great deal of time because to this tool.

- [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) Although we utilized it less frequently than paletton, it is still useful.

We sincerely hope you enjoyed our COLORCAST Design Evolution series.
