Welcome to the last edition of the series. After our days in Gamelab 2015 and Gamepolis 2015, several artists gave us tips about how to improve the gameâ€™s visuals. Some of the comments were contradictory, but all of them agreed on we needed improve the colors, make them unique to distinguish better the color scheme, tonality & shadows of the smart boxes needed a unification too.

The tools that we used to resolve these issues were:

- [Paletton]() helped us to save a lot of time.

- [Coolors]() helpful too but we used it less than paletton.

We hope you enjoyed our Design Evolution series of COLORCAST free. Whether this can be helpful for you or just for entertainment, thanks for reading!
