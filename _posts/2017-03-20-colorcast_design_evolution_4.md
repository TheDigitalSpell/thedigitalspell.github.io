We can see in this drawing the evolution of smart box until the definitive design. For us was essential that this element were clear and simple. The game state can be altered when the player interact with a smart box, depending on its outside/inside configuration. An enabled outside allows  the player send color in its direction and is represented with an external triangle. An enabled inside allows to the smart box receive color in its direction and is represented with a inner triangle with transparent background.As a final step we decided to improve the inside configuration with an additional little black triangle for increase the playerâ€™s perception.
