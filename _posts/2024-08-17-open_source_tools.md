Open-source tools are essential in the ever-changing domain of game development, especially for solo developers. These fantastic tools, often with permissive licenses, provide accessibility, flexibility, and important community support, vital for developers on a tight budget.

MIT, Apache, and GPL are examples of permissive licenses that enable developers to utilize, modify, and distribute the software with minimal restrictions. This significantly boosts creativity and allows developers to tailor tools to meet their specific needs. Moreover, open-source communities collaborate to continuously enhance and update tools, offering developers access to cutting-edge innovations at a cost-effective rate in comparison to proprietary software.

## Tools Overview

We use a carefully chosen set of open-source tools, each selected for their unique characteristics and the benefits of their license:

- **[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/): The MIT License**

The Godot Engine comes with the MIT License, considered to be one of the most forgiving open-source licenses available. The MIT License allows developers to utilize, modify, and share the code of the engine in commercial endeavors without the obligation to disclose their source code.

Independent developers can take advantage of this adaptability, enabling them to customize the engine to meet their project's specific needs and promoting the sharing of improvements within the community.

- **[Kenney Assets](https://kenney.nl): Creative Commons Zero (CC0)**

Kenney Assets are made accessible through the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license, which places the assets in the public domain. Developers can use, modify, and distribute these assets in commercial products without needing to give credit or follow any limitations.

This license allows developers to quickly add high-quality assets to their games without worrying about legal complications, saving them significant time.

- **[Krita](https://krita.org/): GNU General Public License (GPL)**

Krita's distribution falls under the GNU General Public License (GPL), meaning any alterations to the software must remain open-source and follow the same licensing terms. Nevertheless, the artwork made using Krita is not constrained by this license and can be utilized without restrictions in any setting, including commercial endeavors.

By utilizing the GPL, Krita is able to stay cost-free and accessible to everyone, providing robust functionalities similar to pricey proprietary options, which makes it a perfect choice for game artists.

- **[Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev): ISC License**

Lucide Icons are made available under the ISC License, a permissive open-source license similar to the MIT License. It allows for the icons to be used, changed, and shared without many restrictions.

The ISC License enables developers to utilize and alter icons in their projects without constraints, facilitating easy customization of the game's user interface.

- **[Open Game Art](https://opengameart.org): Various Licenses (CC0, CC BY, GPL)**

Assets available on Open Game Art can be used under various open licenses such as Creative Commons Zero, Creative Commons Attribution, and GNU General Public License. Each item is marked with a unique license.

Developers can choose assets that meet their project's licensing needs by selecting from a wide range of available licenses. CC0 assets offer the most freedom, while CC BY requires attribution, and GPL ensures that derivative works remain open-source.

- **[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): Open Font License (OFL)**

Approval: Fonts provided by Google Fonts are typically shared under the Open Font License (OFL). This license allows the fonts to be utilized, altered, and shared for no cost, as long as they are not sold individually. The fonts can be used in any document or application, even commercially, without any restrictions.

With the OFL, game developers can integrate top-notch typography in games freely, enhancing the visual appeal and readability of the user interface.

- **[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/): OpenAI API License**

Access to ChatGPT is possible by using OpenAI's API, with a commercial license required for usage. Although it is not open-source, this license permits the utilization of ChatGPT's functions in different applications such as game development, for personal as well as commercial purposes.

OpenAI provides various licensing options for game developers to utilize ChatGPT's advanced language processing skills in tasks like developing conversations and sparking ideas.
