Today we are going to explain how the tools are integrated into COLORCAST project. First, Cocos Studio Animator allows to design each element of the game in an independent way and to create multiple animations for each one. Next, Cocos Studio Scene allows to import these designs, select an animation to reproduce and edit the transformation attributes desired. Finally, cocos2d-x represents the whole thing correctly and then we apply additional changes from code, like colors or new animationsâ€¦
