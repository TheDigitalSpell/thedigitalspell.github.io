Today we will explain how the tools are integrated into the COLORCAST project.

First, Cocos Studio Animator allows you to design each game piece independently and create different animations for them.

Next, Cocos Studio Scene allows you to import these designs, choose an animation to replicate, and modify the transformation attributes as needed.

Cocos2d-x accurately portrays the entire scene, followed by code-based adjustments such as colors or animations.
