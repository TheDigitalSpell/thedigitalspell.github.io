Welcome to this first post of a series where we want to show you how the game has evolved.

One of the first and crucial point in our development was to find a good level editor. First of all we tried with Tiled, which support *.tmx files, cocos2d-x friendly format. As you can see in the image we had some issues with the levels once they were load in the engine, they were not showing as expected. In this image, you can appreciate the first design of one of the main parts of the game, the smart boxes.
