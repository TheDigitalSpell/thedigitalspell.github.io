Welcome to the first piece in a series showcasing how the game has progressed.

One of the earliest and most important steps in our development was to discover a suitable level editor. First, we tested [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/), which supports *.tmx files in a [Cocos2d-x](https://www.cocos.com/en/cocos2d-x) compatible format.

As you can see in the screenshot, we experienced some issues with the levels once they were loaded into the engine; they did not appear as planned.

In this screenshot, you can also see the earliest design for one of the game's primary components, the **Smart Boxes**.
