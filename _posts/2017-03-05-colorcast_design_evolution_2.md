Following our unfortunate try with Tiled, we looked at new editors.

In our early testing with Cocos Studio 2.x, we discovered some difficulties, including incompatibility with the multiresolution system and multiple tinting mistakes.

So we returned to Cocos Studio 1.x, which was under better development at the time.

We gradually integrated Cocos Studio 1.x into our level editor. In order to accomplish so, we prepared templates for various level sizes, as shown in the attached figure (7x7).

We can also see the next phase in **Smart Box** design here.
