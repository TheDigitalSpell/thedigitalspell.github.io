After our failed attempt with Tiled we investigated new editors. In the initial test made with Cocos Studio 2.x we found some issues: incompatibility with the multiresolution system and multiple errors tinting sprites. So we came back to Cocos Studio 1.x version, which was in a better development state in that moment. Little by little we turned Cocos Studio 1.x into our level editor. In order to do that we created templates for different level sizes, as showed in the attached image (7x7 in this case). We can see the next step in the smart box design here too.
